**A minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic audiovisual performances.**

Programmed in the Cycling'74 Max8 node-based creative coding environment, as an abstracted layer on the Max/MSP audio engine and with the use of Node4Max for parsing, lexing and generative algorithms and Jitter/OpenGL for the visuals and the responsive texteditor.

>See also the [NodeJS Total-Serialism Package](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) for an extensive library of Algorithmic Composition Methods

## üéâ Newest Features

**Control external midi devices or send midi to other Applications with the new `midi` instrument**

```java
set midi getPorts
//=> prints the available devices to the console

new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/4) note(7 1) length(100) gain(0.8)
```

**Input OSC addresses as arguments or output osc-messages in a similar way as using instruments**

```java
set osc default

new synth sine name(sn)
    set sn note(/sine/pitch 0) shape(5 /sine/release)
    set sn fx(reverb 1 /sine/verb)

new emitter osc name(myOSC) someParam(3.14)
    // result => /myOsc/someParam 3.14
```

## üìü About 

**Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music.** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

Mercury uses the [Total Serialism NodeJS](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) package available on npmjs.com. This package features many algorithmic composition methods.

## üî≠ Vision / Goals

- Providing a quick and hands-on coding environment/language for expression, communication and improvisation of livecoded works.
- Using the language as a teaching environment for:
	- introduction in (electronic) music
	- algorithmic composition
	- sequencing
	- synthesis (upcoming)
	- creative coding and live coding.
- Providing creatives with an extensive library of algorithmic composition techniques
	- released as a seperate Node Package titled [Total-Serialism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/total-serialism)
	- exposed in the Mercury environment through Node4Max
- Providing creatives with a multi-purpose non-linear-sequencer 
	- using OSC to communicate with other (creative-coding) platforms
	- using MIDI to communicate with other environments (upcoming)
- Providing creatives with easy sampler/synthesis for sounddesign and composing
	- using external OSC to control parameters in the sampler/synthesis
	- using external MIDI devices and messages to play the sampler/synthesizers (upcoming)
- Working towards a stand-alone application for MacOS and Windows, making workflow easier (upcoming)
- Extending the Mercury users-community and including extensions on the environment in the master-branch

Mercury is a development-in-progress and the language is still very much fluid, with changes made to the language/environment/libraries almost weekly. Feel free the clone/fork this repository, but you might also want to watch and/or star the repo to keep up-to-date with the latest changes whenever they're made.

## üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª Collaborative Coding

It is now possible to code together in Mercury using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.clic.cf/) live coding environment for the browser. 

There are 3 options for how you can use Flok with Mercury:
1. Use Flok to combine Mercury with Hydra visuals (or other languages like Tidal, Foxdot and SuperCollider) on a localhost
2. Collaborate together in the same room (only requires 1 computer to run Mercury)
3. Collaborate remotely over a network (all computers need to run Mercury)

Install NodeJS v.12 [for Mac](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/node-v12.20.0.pkg) or [for Windows](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/node-v12.20.0-x64.msi).

Install the latest version of Mercury via the [quick start quide](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md).

Install Flok via the Terminal with `npm install -g flok-web flok-repl`

**Localhost**

1. Run `flok-web` in the terminal
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `localhost:3000`
3. Setup Flok with target `mercury` (and optionally other targets like `hydra`) and click **Create session**.
4. Copy the `flok-repl -H xxx -s xxx -t mercury` command and run in the terminal.
5. **Join** the Flok with your nickname.

**Collaborate**

Now follow these steps for a succesful setup.
1. Open Google Chrome and go to [https://flok.clic.cf/](https://flok.clic.cf/)
1. Setup Flok with target `mercury` and click **Create session**.
2. Copy the `flok-repl -H xxx -s xxx -t mercury` command and run in the terminal.
4. **Join** the Flok with your nickname.

Now start typing some code! üéµ

- `Ctrl/Alt + Return` to evaluate
- `Ctrl/Alt + .` to silence

Flok will send the entire code via OSC messaging to port 4880. Mercury should be listening to this port automatically. Bug reports are very much welcome in the issues!

## üíª Install

- Follow the [Quick Start](./docs/quick-start.md) guide (for experienced computer users)
- Follow the [Tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md).
- Read the [System Requirements](#system-requirements)
- Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/releases)

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury
$ cd mercury
$ open mercury_ide/mercury_ide.maxproj
```

### üöÄ Quick Start

[Open the Quick Start Guide](./docs/quick-start.md)

### üìñ Tutorial

üöß (work in progress) üöß

If this is your first time with either the usage of creative coding software (like Max8), music theory, electronic music making and programming in general I highly recommend following the tutorial.

[Open the Tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md)

### ‚ö† Troubleshooting

It could be that you are having issues with Mercury, since it's still in development and there may occasionally be some bugs. Please follow the steps below:

[Open the Troubleshooting](./docs/08-troubleshooting.md)

### üìñ Documentation

[**Open the documentation**](./docs/README.md)

### üíª System Requirements

These system requirements are the requirements to install and run Max8 on your computer. A dedicated Graphics Card (GPU) is recommended to run the visual side of Mercury smoothly (the text-editor is part of the visuals since it is programmed in the OpenGL language).

#### OS

`Mac` : OSX 10.13 recommended (at least 10.11.6 or later)

`Windows` : 10 (7, 8 might also work)

#### CPU

`Mac` : Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢2 Duo processor 

`Windows` : 64-bit Intel¬Æ or AMD multi-core processor

Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5 or higher recommended

#### RAM / GPU

4 GB RAM (8 GB or more recommended)

Dedicated Graphics Card recommended

<!-- ### üõ† Build Application

`Optional`

**Why?** - Building the Application is recommended when using Mercury with other MaxMSP projects. This will allow Mercury to have a seperate thread from the other Max processes, giving it enough RAM and CPU space. Also the application will probably run more stable because the project can not be editted anymore. This, of course, also dependents on your system specifications.

**How?** - The Cycling'74 Max8 coding environment is needed to build the application from the `mercury_ide_x.x.x.maxproj` file. Open the `.maxproj` file and select `Build Collective/Application` from the `Settings` menu on the bottom of the project window. *Building the Application is not necessary in order to run the environment!* -->

## üìù Modify Code

`JS code` - Requires a standard code-editor (eg. VSCode or Atom) to edit/modify/save the JS code.

`GenExpr Code` - Requires a standard code-editor (eg. VSCode or Atom) to edit/modify/save the GenExpr code.
