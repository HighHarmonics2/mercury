# 🌕 Mercury Live Coding Environment 

**Welcome to Mercury! ✌️ ☮️ Make Music, Not War!** ☮️ ✌️

**Mercury is a free/open-source, beginner-friendly, minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music performances**

Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) (you're in the right place)
* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground)

**🚀 Start coding with the latest version:** 

`git clone https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury.git`

[**👾 Start coding directly in the playground!** (recommended for beginners)](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

[**🙏 Support Mercury by buying me a coffee ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/tmhglnd)

<!-- ##  Newest Features

**Control external midi devices or send midi to other Applications with the new `midi` instrument**

```java
set midi getPorts
//=> prints the available devices to the console

new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/4) note(7 1) length(100) gain(0.8)
```

**Input OSC addresses as arguments or output osc-messages in a similar way as using instruments**

```java
set osc default

new synth sine name(sn)
    set sn note(/sine/pitch 0) shape(5 /sine/release)
    set sn fx(reverb 1 /sine/verb)

new emitter osc name(myOSC) someParam(3.14)
    // result => /myOsc/someParam 3.14
``` -->

## 📟 About 

**Mercury is a free/open-source, beginner-friendly, minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

## 🎮 Features Overview

Quick access to playback of samples and change timing and tempo of samples or synthesizers

```java
set tempo 89

new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
new sample hat_909 time(3/16)
```

Make rhythmic patterns with sequences of numbers and probabilities

```java
list loBeat [1 0 0 1 0.5]
list hiBeat [0 1 0.2 0]

new sample tabla_lo time(1/8) play(loBeat)
new sample tabla_hi time(1/8) play(hiBeat)
```

Generate psuedorandom melodic content for a synthesizer in a range and set a scale

```java
set scale minor d
set randomSeed 31415

list melody random(16 0 24)

new synth saw note(melody) time(1/16) shape(4 100)
```

Design sounds with various effects

```java
new sample chimes time(2) speed(-0.25) fx(reverb 0.3 15) fx(drive 10) fx(lfo 1/8 sine)
```

Easily give multiple instruments the same effects

```java
new sample chimes time(2)
new sample harp_down time(3)
new sample gong_lo time(5)

set all fx(lfo 1/16) fx(delay) fx(reverb 0.5 11)
```

Generate sequences algorithmically to compose complex structures and choose from an extensive library of algorithms to work with

```java
set scale minor a 

list rhythm euclidean(32 13)

list melody spread(5 0 24)
list melody palinedrome(melody)
list melody clone(melody 0 5 7 3)
list melody lace(melody melody)

new synth triangle note(melody 1) shape(1 80) play(rhythm)
```

Control external midi devices or send midi to other applications and use clock sync

```java
set midi getPorts
//=> prints the available devices to the console
new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/4) note(7 1) length(100) sync(on)
```

Control other environments via OSC-messages

```java
list params [0.25 0.5 0.75]

new emitter osc address(yourDevice) theParam(params) time(1/4)

// emits => /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.5
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.75
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          etc...
```

Easily control parameters in Mercury via external OSC-messages

```java
new synth triangle fx(reverb '/extOSC/verbAmount') fx(filter low '/extOSC/cutoff' 0.4) time(1) shape(1 1000)
```

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Collaborative Coding

You can code together in Mercury by using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.cc/) live coding environment for the browser developed by Damián Silvani (a.k.a. Munshkr). Flok is a web-based P2P collaborative editor for live coding music and graphics. Similar to Etherpad, but focused on code evaluation for livecoding.

- [Start coding together here](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/collaborate)

## 💻 Install

- 📖 [I need some help installing](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/getting-started#-mercury4max)
- 🚀 [I'm an experienced computer user](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/getting-started#-mercury4max)
- 💻 [Is my computer powerful enough?](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/getting-started#-system-requirements)

OR

- 🤓 I'll just download and figure it out myself

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury
$ cd mercury
$ open mercury_ide/mercury_ide.maxproj
```

### ⚠ Troubleshooting

It could be that you are having issues with Mercury. Please follow the steps below:

- [Open the Troubleshooting](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/usage/troubleshooting)

### ⌨️ External Editor

Instead of using the editor built in the Max Mercury version you can also load an external textfile or use a plugin for Pulsar (previously Atom).

- [Follow the instructions here for the Pulsar Plugin](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/usage/editors)
- [Follow the instructions here for other editors](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/usage/editors)
