# üèÉ Quick Start

This quick start guide is meant for people who are confident in working with the computer and have some experience with (creative) coding, music technology and music making.

# üíª Install Mercury

Read the [system requirements](./../README.md#-system-requirements) first before getting started.

1. Download and install Max8 via any of the links below. At the moment Mercury seems to run best in Max8.0.8. **You do not need to buy a license in order to use Mercury!** üòé

- [Windows](https://akiaj5esl75o5wbdcv2a-maxmspjitter.s3.amazonaws.com/Max808_x64_190808.zip)
- [Mac](https://akiaj5esl75o5wbdcv2a-maxmspjitter.s3.amazonaws.com/Max808_190808.dmg)
- If links are not working you can go to [https://cycling74.com/downloads/older](https://cycling74.com/downloads/older)

2. Launch Max8 when the installation is done. It will create a `Max 8` folder in your `Documents`. In there you may create a folder named `Projects`. The full path should now look like this: `<User>/Documents/Max 8/Projects`

3. Now [download the latest release](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/releases) or clone/fork Mercury to the Projects folder in your Documents.

	```
	Download latest release and unzip entire folder in ~/Documents/Max 8/Projects
	```
	Or via commandline
	```
	$ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
	$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury
	```
	
	Now your filepath should look something like: `<User>/Documents/Max 8/Projects/mercury-v.0.13.0-alpha`

# üöÄ Launch Mercury

Launch Mercury by double clicking `mercury_ide.maxproj` or 

```
$ cd mercury
$ open mercury_ide/mercury_ide.maxproj
```

- ‚è≥ Give it some time to load.

- ‚ö† **Mac 10.14+ Users**: Make sure you give permissions under Security & Privacy Preferences.

In the `_mercury_main` window:

- üì∫ Turn the **Rendering on**
- üîà Turn the **Audio on**

In the `mercury` code editor:

- üíª Type the following code 

	```java
	set tempo 110

	new sample kick_house time(1/4)
	```

- üîä Hit `alt + return` or `Menubar > File > Execute Code` 
	- *Mac users: Disable the Alert Volume in `System Preferences > Sounds` to disable the error sound when using shortkeys*

Adjust settings under `Menubar > Settings`. [For detailed explanation go here](./07-environment.md#settings)

You are now ready to start coding your first sounds! üé∂üíªüé∂

# üé≤ Play!

Now go ahead and play all you want! For further information on the syntax and code see:

- View some of the example code via the menu `Explanation > Random Example`
- [Tutorial](./tutorial.md)
- [Documentation](./README.md)
