# Shortkeys

Mercury has various shortkeys that help you navigate the editor quickly during liveperformances. At the moment shortkeys are default for Mac platforms, and might not all work on Windows platforms. There may also be some issues with non UK/US keyboards. If you encounter any issues with this, please file an issue.

## Default Arrow Key Navigation

```
UP    = up one line
DOWN  = down one line
LEFT  = back one character
RIGHT = forward one character
```
```
Alt + UP     = jump to top of editor (end of the line)
Alt + DOWN   = jump to end of editor (end of the line)
Alt + LEFT   = jump to beginning of the line
Alt + RIGHT  = jump to end of the line
```
```
Alt + A = back one character
Alt + S = down one line
Alt + D = forward one character
Alt + W = up one line
```

## Default Copy/Paste/Delete

Copy/Paste/Paste-Replace/Delete only works inside the editor. In order to input or output code to a different application you have to save the file as a `.txt` or open a `.txt` file from disk.

```
Alt + X = delete the line where the cursor is located
Alt + C = copy the line where the cursor is located
Alt + V = paste insert a line of code where the cursor is located
Alt + P = paste replace a line where the cursor is located
```

## Default Code Commands

```
Alt + Return = execute code
Alt + . = silence the sound
Alt + / = (un)comment a line of code
Alt + , = disable/enable editor
```

## Customize Shortkeys

You can customize the shortkeys by opening the `Setup Shortkeys` under `Settings` in the menubar. 
- Select the key you would like to customize in the dropdown menu on the top
- Click `change keycommand`, it now displays `waiting for keys...`
- Hit the key combination you would like to use for this command and release the keys to store
- Check if stored correctly in the scroll-menu below. Every command displays the shortcut and keycode
