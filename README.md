**A minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic audiovisual performances.**

Programmed in the Cycling'74 Max8 node-based creative coding environment, as an abstracted layer on the Max/MSP audio engine and with the use of Node4Max for parsing, lexing and generative algorithms and Jitter/OpenGL for the visuals and the responsive texteditor.

>See also the [NodeJS Total-Serialism Package](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) for an extensive library of Algorithmic Composition Methods

## üéâ Newest Features

**Input OSC addresses as arguments for instrument methods and control the parameters externally**

```java
set osc default

new synth sine name(sn)
    set sn note(/sine/pitch 0) shape(5 /sine/release)
    set sn fx(reverb 1 /sine/verb)
```

**new `OSC`-object, output sequences as osc-messages, custom naming of messages in a intuitive way (similar to making instruments).**

```java
set osc default

new emitter osc name(myOSC) someParam(3.14)
// result => /myOsc/someParam 3.14
```

## üìü About 

>Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music. 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

Mercury uses the [Total Serialism NodeJS](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) package available on npmjs.com. This package features many algorithmic composition methods.

## üî≠ Vision / Goals

- Providing a quick and hands-on coding environment/language for expression, communication and improvisation of livecoded works.
- Using the language as a teaching environment for:
	- introduction in (electronic) music
	- algorithmic composition
	- sequencing
	- synthesis (upcoming)
	- creative coding and live coding.
- Providing creatives with an extensive library of algorithmic composition techniques
	- released as a seperate Node Package titled [Total-Serialism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/total-serialism)
	- exposed in the Mercury environment through Node4Max
- Providing creatives with a multi-purpose non-linear-sequencer 
	- using OSC to communicate with other (creative-coding) platforms
	- using MIDI to communicate with other environments (upcoming)
- Providing creatives with easy sampler/synthesis for sounddesign and composing
	- using external OSC to control parameters in the sampler/synthesis
	- using external MIDI devices and messages to play the sampler/synthesizers (upcoming)
- Working towards a stand-alone application for MacOS and Windows, making workflow easier (upcoming)
- Extending the Mercury users-community and including extensions on the environment in the master-branch

Mercury is a development-in-progress and the language is still very much fluid, with changes made to the language/environment/libraries almost weekly. Feel free the clone/fork this repository, but you might also want to watch and/or star the repo to keep up-to-date with the latest changes whenever they're made.

## üìñ Tutorial

üöß (work in progress) üöß

If this is your first time with either the usage of creative coding software (like Max8), music theory, electronic music making and programming in general I highly recommend following the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial.md)

[Open the Tutorial](/docs/tutorial.md)

## üíª Install

Read the [system requirements](#system-requirements) first before getting started.

1. Download and install **Max 8.0.8** (no License required to run Mercury!)
	- [Windows](https://akiaj5esl75o5wbdcv2a-maxmspjitter.s3.amazonaws.com/Max808_x64_190808.zip)
	- [Mac](https://akiaj5esl75o5wbdcv2a-maxmspjitter.s3.amazonaws.com/Max808_190808.dmg)
	- If links are not working go to [https://cycling74.com/downloads/older](https://cycling74.com/downloads/older)
	- *Newer versions of Max can be used as well, but 8.0.8 has proven to be the most stable so far*
<!--
2. Add the following dependencies to the `~/Documents/Max 8/Packages` folder:
	- [`misc-max-abstractions`](https://github.com/tmhglnd/misc-max-abstractions)
	- [`reverb-yafr-mods`](https://github.com/tmhglnd/reverb-yafr-mods)
	- Optional:
		- `Syphon` : available as download in the Max Package Manager
	<!-- - [~~pass-comparators~~](https://github.com/tmhglnd/pass-comparators) <- now included in the package
	<!-- - ~~jasch package~~ <- temporarily disabled function -->

2. Download, clone or fork Mercury to the Projects folder in your Documents:
```
1. Download zip and unpack in ~/Documents/Max 8/Projects (create Projects folder if necessary)
2. Open mercury_ide.maxproj
```
commandline:
```
$ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
    if not a directory, first: 
    $ mkdir ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
    $ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects

$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury
```

### üöÄ Getting Started

[Open the Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started.md)

### ‚ö† System Requirements

These system requirements are the requirements to install and run Max8 on your computer. A dedicated Graphics Card (GPU) is recommended to run the visual side of Mercury smoothly (the text-editor is part of the visuals since it is programmed in the OpenGL language).

```
Mac OSX 10.11.6 or later
Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢2 Duo processor (Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5 or higher recommended) 
4 GB RAM (8 GB or more recommended)
(Dedicated Graphics Card recommended)
```

```
Windows 7, 8 or 10
64-bit Intel¬Æ or AMD multi-core processor. (Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5 or higher processor or recommended)
4 GB RAM (8 GB or more recommended)
(Dedicated Graphics Card recommended)
```

Tested working on a variety of computers and operating systems.

```
Mac OSX 10.12
Mac OSX 10.14
Microsoft Windows 10 Home
```

### üõ† Build Application

`Optional`

**Why?** - Building the Application is recommended when using Mercury with other MaxMSP projects. This will allow Mercury to have a seperate thread from the other Max processes, giving it enough RAM and CPU space. Also the application will probably run more stable because the project can not be editted anymore. This, of course, also dependents on your systems specifications.

**How?** - The Cycling'74 Coding environment is needed to build the application from the `mercury_ide_x.x.x.maxproj` file. Open the `.maxproj` file and select `Build Collective/Application` from the `Settings` menu on the bottom of the project window. *Building the Application is not necessary in order to run the environment!*
