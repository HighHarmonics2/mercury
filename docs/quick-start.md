# üèÉ Quick Start

Hi! Welcome to the Quick Start guide. If you experience any issues with installing or running the code, please have a look in the Tutorial or Troubleshooting sections. This Quick Start guide is meant for people who are confident in working with the computer and have some experience with (creative) coding, music technology and music making.

# üíª Install Mercury

Please read the [system requirements](./../README.md#-system-requirements) before getting started.

Mercury runs in Max8 (sometimes also called MaxMSP), a node-based creative coding environment from Cycling'74. **You do not need to buy a Max-license in order to use Mercury!** üòé At the moment Mercury seems to run best in Max8.0.8, but if this crashes for you please try the latest Max version from their website. 

1. Please download Max8 through any of the links below.

- [Windows](https://akiaj5esl75o5wbdcv2a-maxmspjitter.s3.amazonaws.com/Max808_x64_190808.zip)
- [Mac](https://akiaj5esl75o5wbdcv2a-maxmspjitter.s3.amazonaws.com/Max808_190808.dmg)
- If links are not working you can go to [https://cycling74.com/downloads/older](https://cycling74.com/downloads/older)

2. Once you installed Max8 you can launch it. It will create a `Max 8` folder in your `Documents`. In there you may create a folder named `Projects`. The full path should now look like this: `<User>/Documents/Max 8/Projects`

3. Now [download the latest release](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/releases)

	```
	Download latest release and unzip entire folder in ~/Documents/Max 8/Projects
	```
	
	Or for git-users via the commandline, you can clone/fork Mercury to the Projects folder in your Documents.
	
	```
	$ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
	$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury
	```
	
	Now your filepath should look something like: `<User>/Documents/Max 8/Projects/mercury-v.0.13.0-alpha`

# üöÄ Launch Mercury

Launch Mercury by double clicking `mercury_ide.maxproj` located in the folder `mercury-v.x.x.x/mercury-ide` or by running the following terminal command: 

```
$ cd mercury
$ open mercury_ide/mercury_ide.maxproj
```

If you like you can create a shortcut or alias on your desktop for it or in your Applications folder.

- ‚è≥ Give it some time to load.

<!-- - ‚ö† **Mac 10.14+ Users**: Make sure you give permissions under Security & Privacy Preferences. -->

In the `_mercury_main` window:

- üì∫ Turn the **Rendering on**
- üîà Turn the **Audio on**

In the `mercury` code editor:

- üíª Type the following code 

	```java
	set tempo 110

	new sample kick_house time(1/4)
	```

- üîä Hit `alt + return` or `Menubar > File > Execute Code` 
	- *Mac users: Disable the Alert Volume in `System Preferences > Sounds` to disable the error sound when using shortkeys*

- Adjust shortkey commands under `Menubar > Settings > Shortkeys Setup`

- Adjust settings under `Menubar > Settings`. [For detailed explanation go here](./07-environment.md#settings)

You are now ready to start coding your first sounds! üé∂üíªüé∂

# üé≤ Play!

Now go ahead and play all you want! For further information on the syntax and code see:

- View some of the example code via the menu `Explanation > Random Example`
- [Tutorial](./tutorial.md)
- [Documentation](./README.md)
